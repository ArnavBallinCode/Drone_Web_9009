## üõ†Ô∏è Windows Version ‚Äî Installation & Configuration Guide

### üîç System Requirements

| Component            | Minimum Requirement                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Operating System     | Windows 10 / Windows 11 (64-bit)                  |
| CPU                  | Intel i5 7th Gen or AMD Ryzen 5 equivalent       |
| RAM                  | 8 GB (16 GB recommended for high throughput)     |
| Storage              | 1 GB free disk space                              |
| Connectivity         | USB 2.0/3.0 port or telemetry radio interface   |
| Software Dependencies | Node.js v16+, Python 3.8+, Git                   |

---

### ‚ö° Step 1: Clone Repository & Setup Environment

Open **PowerShell** or **Windows Terminal** as Administrator and execute:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/skysync-gcs.git
cd skysync-gcs
````

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Install Frontend Dependencies

Using your preferred Node.js package manager (npm or pnpm):

```powershell
# Using npm
npm install

# Or using pnpm (recommended for faster installs)
pnpm install
```

---

### üêç Step 3: Setup Python Backend Environment

* Install Python 3.8+ for Windows (from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/))
* Open a new PowerShell window and install required packages:

```powershell
pip install pymavlink websockets asyncio pyserial
```

---

### üîå Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a file `.env.local` in the root folder with the following content (modify `COM` port to match your device):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8765
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAVLINK_CONNECTION=COM3
NEXT_PUBLIC_BAUD_RATE=57600
```

> **Note:** Use Windows Device Manager to confirm your Pixhawk or telemetry radio COM port.

---

### üöÅ Step 5: Establish MAVLink Connection

We recommend using **MAVProxy** on Windows as a UDP bridge:

```powershell
mavproxy.py --master=COM3 --baud=57600 --out=udp:localhost:14550 --out=udp:localhost:14551
```

This creates robust multiplexed MAVLink data streams for concurrent applications.

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 6: Launch Services

Open **three separate PowerShell terminals**:

1. **Telemetry Listener**

```powershell
python listen.py --connection COM3 --baud 57600
```

2. **Calibration Server**

```powershell
python calibrating/calibration_server.py
```

3. **Frontend Development Server**

```powershell
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

---

### üåê Step 7: Access SkySync GCS

Open your preferred browser (Edge/Chrome recommended) and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Experience the full telemetry dashboard, 3D visualization, and calibration workflows.
